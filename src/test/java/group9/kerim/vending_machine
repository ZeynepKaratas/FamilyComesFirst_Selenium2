First we get all the requirements and test cases to test the vending machine
Requirement can be: -> vending machine must track the inventory
		    -> user should be able to insert bills, coins, and a card
		    -> machine must be able to identify invalid card, insufficient cash/coin entry or invalid currency, and also unavailable item
		    -> product can be selectable by pressing corresponding button on keypad.
		    -> user should select 1 item at a time
		    -> machine should do full refund if user cancels the purchase
		    -> Finally if all successful, user should get the selected item

	First we need to test functionality:

--> when we enter valid method of payment with sufficient fund, we should be able to make a selection for the desired item and the machine should give the item
    without a delay.
	OR
--> when whe enter invalid card or invalid currency, machine should display error message "invalid method of payment"
--> valid card with insufficient funds or insufficient amount of bill/coin machine should display "insufficient funds for the selected item"
--> if the item selected is not in the inventory the machine should display "unavailable selection"
--> if user randomly press a button or buttons on the key-pad, machine should display error message "invalid selection".
--> if user cannot provide the funds or cannot make a selection in timely manner then the amount should be returned.

	Performance Testing:

 -- As long as the valid payment provided and also there are available items, user should be able to make a purchase. The machine should process the purchase smoothly
 -- Behaviour at lower or higher voltage: should adjust the voltage within the limit difference
 -- The machine should process the purchase within an acceptable time

	Hardware Testing:

 -- dimension of the machine
 -- hieght/level of dispenser
 -- material of machine
 -- sharp edges
 -- door
 -- color
 -- voltage
 -- temperature of the inside and the surrounding

	Visibility Testing:

 -- "Welcome" text should be displayed on the screen.
 -- Verifying display screen; text size, text color, language, text dimension, pixels
 -- All products should be visible and aranged in an order
 -- There should be lightning inside the machine (night or day time light)

	Security Testing:

 -- For product security -> machine door lock/ alarm
 -- Cash security
